# üßëüíª LeetCode Solutions: *"Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, Ctrl+Panic"*  

**"Where brute force meets regret, and recursion meets stack overflow."**  

### üî• Repository Highlights:
- **`O(n!)` Solutions** - For when you *really* hate your computer  
- **50 Shades of Timeout** - A tragic love story of `while True:` and TLE  
- **Edge Case Cemetery** - RIP `nums = []` (2015-2023)  
- **One-Liner Graveyard** - "Readable" solutions that now need GPS 

### üìä Progress Report:
```python

    return {
        'easy':   "‚úÖ (after 3 tries)",
        'medium': "ü§î (with Googling)",
        'hard':   "üò≠ (with tears)"
    }

# üíª Full-Stack Grind: SQL, JS & LeetCode Tears 

**"SELECT * FROM solutions WHERE confidence > 0.1 ORDER BY caffeine_level DESC"**

### üé™ The Coding Circus
- **SQL**: Where `JOIN` feels more complicated than my last relationship
- **JavaScript**: `typeof problem === "undefined"` until 3am
- **LeetCode**: Officially diagnosed with "Over-optimization Syndrome"
